Welcome to my new Blog! I am very excited to be writing about web development, technologies and daily experiences. This blog shall be a source of information and a memory aid for my sometimes way too easily distracted mind. 

I find that the way I work has changed in the last two years after finishing my studies at university. Like then my most important task is to be learning and progressing every day. Yet, while at university the learning process was defined by clearly structured documents, it is now defined by a ton of material which is spread throughout the internet. Even though I feel that I am progressing much quicker now, I still feel the need to structure myself more.

The mental model I have in mind for learning is being a machine that collects data and information, puts it in context, makes a realization and afterwards starts again. Sometimes I fear to already forget the realizations I made yesterday. Most probably a blog will help me to cement them and to be progressing more effectively.

This blog aims at providing structure by forcing me to write down what I learned. I want to be writing regurlarly about the realizations I made. Or, as my programming-teacher at university once put it:
